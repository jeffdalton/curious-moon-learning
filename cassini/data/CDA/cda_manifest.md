# Manifest of Impact Data from Cassini, June 2005
Total rows: 57029
Column count: 30,

## Description:
Detector responses and derived quantities from the Cassini dust detector as well as spacecraft geometry information for each event wich triggered the instrument. An event class flag is provided to distinguish between 4 differents types of signals: test pulses, noise, weak and strong impacts. However, this flag value may be poorly reliable. Only a carefully analysis of the individual charge signals combined with the CDA documentation (see SRAMAETAL2004B) can confirm the event class. For each event, and for each of the QP, QT, QI, QC channels, a flag is set to 1 if a charge signal was  transmitted to Earth. The charge signal can then be found in the appropriate directory.
